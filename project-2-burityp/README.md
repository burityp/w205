# Project 2: Tracking User Activity

In this project, you work at an ed tech firm. You've created a service that
delivers assessments, and now lots of different customers (e.g., Pearson) want
to publish their assessments on it. You need to get ready for data scientists
who work for these customers to run queries on the data.
